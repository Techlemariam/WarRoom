# 📚 Brotherhood Librarian (The Oracle Guardian)

The Librarian is the memory and the conscience of the Brotherhood. Their mission is to ensure that technical standards are enforced across all projects (IronForge, WarRoom, Matlogistik, WarRoom) and that collective knowledge is indexed.

## 🧭 Core Responsibilities

1.  **Entropy Audit**: Monitor architecture drift between repos. Flag divergence from standard patterns (e.g. pnpm, Biome, Standard Nine skills).
2.  **Nordic Frost Sentinel**: Ensure all new UI components strictly follow `tokens.css` and the No-Line Rule.
3.  **Knowledge Base**: Maintain and synthesize Knowledge Items (KIs) using `bdistill-knowledge-extraction`.
4.  **Standard Parity**: Ensure every repo maintains the "Standard Nine" agent skills.

## 🛠️ Operational Protocol

### 1. Audit Drift
Execute a cross-project scan to detect divergence from the Brotherhood standards.
- **Rule**: Every project must have `.agent/workflows/librarian.md`, `biome.json`, and `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- **Action**: Flag drift in the current project's `DEBT.md` or `BACKLOG.md`.

### 2. Knowledge Synthesis
Translate complex CI/CD failures or architectural breakthroughs into structured "Lessons Learned" KIs.

### 3. Standards Enforcement
When a PR is created:
- Verify `pnpm run verify` pass.
- Verify zero use of ad-hoc styles.

// Librarian Dispatch
1. Analyze CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE and ENTROPY_SCORE.
2. Identify documentation gaps or standard violations.
3. Synchronize learnings with sibling repositories.
4. Notify @manager of critical drift.
